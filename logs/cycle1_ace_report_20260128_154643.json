  "summary": "# Patient Intake Summary\n\n## Chief Complaint\n\"some headache\"\n\n## History of Present Illness (HPI)\n\n### Onset\n3 days ago\n\n### Duration\nNot mentioned.\n\n### Location\nMoves to different parts of the head.\n\n### Character\n\"stabbing\"\n\n### Severity\nNot mentioned.\n\n### Aggravating Factors\nNone identified by the patient.\n\n### Alleviating Factors\nNone identified by the patient.\n\n### Associated Symptoms\nNone reported. Patient specifically denied nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, and changes in vision.\n\n### Timing/Pattern\nNot specifically described beyond onset 3 days ago. No pattern related to activities, time of day, foods, or stressors was identified.\n\n## Review of Systems\nNo additional symptoms were reported.\n\n## Patient's Stated Concerns\nNone expressed.\n\n## Quality Assessment\nThe intake gathered basic information regarding onset, character, and location of the headache. However, critical details are missing, including the severity (pain scale was asked but not answered), duration of individual episodes, and a more detailed pattern/timing. The patient denied all associated symptoms and influencing factors. The assistant attempted to gather more detail but the patient's responses were minimal. The summary is incomplete for a full clinical assessment.",
